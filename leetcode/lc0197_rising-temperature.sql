# Write your MySQL query statement below
# DATEDIFF(expr1, expr2)
# DATEDIFF() returns expr1 − expr2 expressed as a value in days from one date to the other.
#

select w1.id as 'Id'
from weather w1
    join
    weather w2 on datediff(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1 and w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature
