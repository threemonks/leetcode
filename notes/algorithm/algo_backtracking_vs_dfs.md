##  Difference between DFS and Backtracking
* Backtracking is a more general purpose algorithm.
* DFS is a specific form of backtracking related to searching tree structures.
* DFS handles an explicit tree, while Backtracking handles an implicit tree
* DFS is a special type of backtracking algorithmic design paradigm where the process of backtracking takes place in the leaf nodes. In case of backtracking,the algorithm also rejects the useless branch of the state-space tree.This is why DFS maintains the entire tree structure while Backtracking maintaines a pruned tree
